# Bank-Management-System

This is a simple console application written in C++ that simulates the basic operations of a bank management system.The program uses a switch statement to allow the user to choose from different options, such as creating a new account,
depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and bank record.

# How to Run the Program

To run the program, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can then download or clone this repository to your local machine and compile the source code using your compiler.

# Program Features

The program allows the user to perform the following operations:

1. Create a new account
2. Deposit money into an account
3. Withdraw money from an account
4. Check the balance of an account
5. Official bank record
6. Exit

The user can choose any of these options by entering the corresponding number when prompted. The program also includes basic error handling to prevent invalid inputs.

# Future Improvements

This program is a simple demonstration of how a bank management system can be implemented in C++. However, there are several improvements that can be made to make the program more robust and user-friendly. For example, the program could be modified to include more error handling and validation checks, as well as support for multiple users and accounts. Additionally, a graphical user interface could be developed to make the program more intuitive and easier to use.
